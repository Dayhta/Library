## Constants

Syntax:

`const` `<const name>` `<data type>` = `<value>`


Untyped Constant

- Constants are untyped unless they are explicity given a type at declaration

- Allow for flexibility

```go

const age = 12

const h_name, h_age = 'Hermione', 12

```


Typed constant

- Constants are typed when yoi explicity specicfy the type in the declaration

- Flexibility that comes with untyped cosntants is lost

```go

const name string = "Harry potter"

const age int = 12
```
